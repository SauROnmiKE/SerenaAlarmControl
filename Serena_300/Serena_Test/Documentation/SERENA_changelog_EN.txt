        | 1.2.0a: Programmed the "DISARM" button. It prompts to the 5-Digit password input. Password check is also done, which disarms the alarm (without sending a signal to a relay or something else) (13/11/2016, 14:15) 
  BETA  | 1.2.1a: Fixed an issue where the user couldn't type any numbers after the password confirmation check. If the user pressed "NO", he/she couldn't then type a new password until the "CLEAR" button was presed. This is now fixed 		| (14/11/2016, 13:32)

	| 1.4.3b: Fixed a bug where the clear button on the disarm pass input wouldn't actually reset the "autoinput" array (17/11/2016, 00:05)
________| 1.4.4b: The "SET AUTO-ARM PASS" button, will now prompt the user to the second options menu when the password is changed, instead of the first one (18/11/2016, 10:02)
